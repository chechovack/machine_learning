# 📊 Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects  -- PART 1
This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning techniques explained and developed in the Advanced AI Bootcamp carried out by the initiative *"Talento Tech"* of the Colombian ICT Ministery in 2024. These techniques included **regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter optimization, and reinforcement learning**. 

## 🚀 **PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS**  

### 1️⃣ **Regression & Classification**  
- Linear & Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Regularization (L1 (LASSO), L2 (Ridge), Elastic Net) & Statistic Exploration with Data  
- Model evaluation (MSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC)
- Applied real-life cases  

### 2️⃣ **Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction**  
- K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & t-SNE for feature reduction  

### 3️⃣ **Hyperparameter Optimization**  
- Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization  
- Improving model performance using tuning techniques  

### 4️⃣ **Reinforcement Learning**  
- Implementing Q-Learning & Deep Q Networks (DQN)  
- Training agents using TensorFlow & OpenAI Gym
